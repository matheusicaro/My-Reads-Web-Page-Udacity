# MY READS UDACITY - v1.0#

In the MyReads project, it is a bookcase application that allows you to select and categorize the books you have read, are currently reading or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to create the application.

Also, this app uses a back-end API that is a virtual library made available by Udacity, which consists of hundreds of books to be queried and persists as you interact with the application.

### Starting from scratch ###

This application started through the Create React App to create a new React application. However, all visual styles and design, were proposed by myself, Matheus Icarus.

### App Functionality ###

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (ie categories), each containing a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently reading
* I want to read
* Read

Each book has a control that allows you to select the bookcase from that book. When you select a different shelf, the book is moved there.

### Future Projects ###

This project is still under development and will in the future have new features and bug fixes, especially for mobile devices, soon v2.0 version.
